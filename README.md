# PYGAMES
This repository contains several games that I learned to make through a UDEMY class. Immense THANKS and CREDITS to martinyanev!
There are text based games along with other games that actually utilize the pygames library.

NOTE: I didn't incorporate the text font, images, and audio into this repository; thus, you would have to find them by yourself. 
This allows you to be more creative and make the game as wonky as possible (I used different images to make the games look super ... interesting).
